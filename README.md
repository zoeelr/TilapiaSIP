# julia Tilapia SIP

A numerical simulation exploring how susceptible tilapia, infected tilapia, and pelican populations evolve over time using stochastic differential equations.
Based on work initially done by [Mandal and Banerjee](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267143963_Deterministic_Chaos_vs_Stochastic_Fluctuation_in_an_Eco-epidemic_Model).
